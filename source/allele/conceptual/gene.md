title: Gene
---

Definition
----------

A genomic region identified by a collection of alternately spliced ReferenceTranscriptSequences, given a name by one or more naming agencies.

(Note, I like the SO ontology around genes, but I do not like the definition, which implys to me that the gene must be functional. - CB)

Scope and Usage
---------------

Included under this definition of gene are:
..* Protein coding genes
..* Pseudogenes
..* Non-Coding RNA sequences
..* Computationally Predicted Genes

There is no guarantee that a gene is ever transcribed, such as in some computationally predicted genes or pseudogenes.   Furthermore, many genes are untranslated.

The grouping together of ReferenceTranscriptSequencing and the assignment of names must be performed by a recognized public group such as NCBI or HGNC.

Exclusions and Limitations
