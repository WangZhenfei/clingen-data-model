Scope and Usage
---------------

Genomic DNA is transcribed to RNA, but it is most common for transcripts to be recorded in databases using their complimentary DNA (cDNA) sequences. Therefore, the individual characters of a TranscriptReferenceSequence are the four DNA nucleotides: A,G,T,C.  

A TranscriptReferenceSequence may correspond to either a coding or non-coding transcript.  If the transcript is coding, the TranscriptReferenceSequence will link to a ProteinReferenceSequence.  

TranscriptReferenceSequences may correspond to any transcribed sequence including, but not limited to a gene transcript, a pseudogene transcript, an alternately spliced transcript, a noncoding RNA, or a computationally discovered transcript.
