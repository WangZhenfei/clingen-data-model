##SimpleAlleleRelationshipType
Classifies relationship types between two simple alleles (e.g. nucleotide allele, NM\_007294.3(BRCA1):c.5297T>G "has the protein effect" NP\_009225.1(BRCA1):p.Ile1766Ser).

The value set to instantiate this attribute should be drawn from a terminologically robust code system that consists of or contains concepts to support the allele canonicalization process, in particular the process for
