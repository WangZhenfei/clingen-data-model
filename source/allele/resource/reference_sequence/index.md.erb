Scope and Usage
---------------

All alleles are described relative to a ReferenceSequence by way of the SimpleAllele.ReferenceCoordinate 
[see SimpleAllele](../simple_allele/index.html). Both the SimpleAllele position (or coordinate) and sequence 
at that postion are relative to the ReferenceSequence.

The current version of the model was based on four specific types of conceptual reference sequences; 
ChromosomeReferenceSequence, GeneReferenceSequence, TranscriptReferenceSequence and AminoAcidReferenceSequence.

Notes
-----

* This version of the ReferenceSequence resource only considers the related reference sequence associations 
between amino acid and transcript reference sequences. This has constrained the scope of codes in the 
[value set](/allele/implementation/value_set_list/reference_sequence_relationship_type.html) for the 
ReferenceSequence.related.relatedType attribute. 


Definitions & Bindings
------------------

{:.h4-definition}
#### ReferenceSequence

{:.dl-horizontal .dl-definition}
Definition
: Stable, reliable, public consensus sequence of a portion of the genome against which alleles are aligned and described.

Control
: 1..1

Requirements
: For every SimpleAllele.ReferenceCoordinate there must be a corresponding reference sequence.

{:.h4-definition}
#### ReferenceSequence.identifier

{:.dl-horizontal .dl-definition}
Definition
: The versioned accession that can be used to uniquely identify the sequence in a public database. 
All users of reference sequences SHALL be sure of the identity of the reference sequence.

Control
: 1..1

Type
: Identifier

Requirements
: For ReferenceSequence, an identifier is valid unless the accession is withdrawn. If a new version 
of a sequence is created, it will be given a different versioned accession, and therefore a different 
identifier. In this case, the previous identifier is still valid: it can still be used to retrieve 
the given sequence, even if that sequence is no longer the most recent sequence associated with a 
given entity.

{:.h4-definition}
#### ReferenceSequence.referenceSequenceType

{:.dl-horizontal .dl-definition}
Definition
: The type of reference sequence.  Currently, the supported types are Transcript, Gene, Chromosome and Amino Acid (see Binding).

Control
: 1..1

Binding
: ReferenceSequenceType: [reference-sequence-type](/allele/implementation/value_set_list/reference_sequence_type.html)  
(Codes identifying kinds of reference sequences)

Type
: code

{:.h4-definition}
#### ReferenceSequence.chromosome

{:.dl-horizontal .dl-definition}
Definition
: The chromosome to which the reference sequence is bound.  The chromosome to which the reference sequence is naturally bound.  
This should be provided when the sequence represents a 'chromosome'.

Control
: 0..1

Binding
: ReferenceSequenceChromosome: [reference-sequence-chromosome](/allele/implementation/value_set_list/reference_sequence_chromosome.html) (Codes identifying human chromosomes.)

Type
: code

{:.h4-definition}
#### ReferenceSequence.cdsStart

{:.dl-horizontal .dl-definition}
Definition
: The offset of the start of the coding region from the start of the reference sequence. This should be provided when the sequence represents a 'transcript'.
NOTE: Unlike reference coordinates, this is a 1-based index representing the position of the nucleotide that starts the coding region.

Control
: 0..1

Type
: integer

{:.h4-definition}
#### ReferenceSequence.cdsEnd

{:.dl-horizontal .dl-definition}
Definition
: The offset of the end of the coding region from the start of the reference sequence. This should be provided when the sequence represents a 'transcript'.
NOTE: Unlike reference coordinates, this is a 1-based index representing the position of the nucleotide that starts the coding region.

Control
: 0..1

Type
: integer

{:.h4-definition}
#### ReferenceSequence.gene

{:.dl-horizontal .dl-definition}
Definition
: Identifies the gene related to a 'gene' or 'transcript' reference sequence.

Control
: 0..1

Type
: Resource([Gene](../gene/index.html))

{:.h4-definition}
#### ReferenceSequence.referenceGenome

{:.dl-horizontal .dl-definition}
Definition
: genome build assembly and version identified by a CodeableConcept
The genome build in which the chromosomal reference sequence is referenced.  
NOTE: The current version of the model does not provide for the same version of a chromosomal reference sequence to be associated with more than one reference genome build.

Control
: 0..1

Type
: CodeableConcept

{:.h4-definition}
#### ReferenceSequence.related

{:.dl-horizontal .dl-definition}
Definition
: The relationship between a different reference sequence to provide additional context. 
NOTE: The current version of the resource only defines relationship type terminology bindings 
to support the relationship between transcript and amino acid reference sequences.

Control
: 0..1

{:.h4-definition}
#### ReferenceSequence.related.relatedType

{:.dl-horizontal .dl-definition}
Definition
: The type or relationship between an amino acid and trascript or vice versa.

Control
: 0..1

Binding
: ReferenceSequenceRelationshipType: [reference-sequence-relationship-type](/allele/implementation/value_set_list/reference_sequence_relationship_type.html) (Codes describing the relationships between ReferenceSequences)

Type
: code

{:.h4-definition}
#### ReferenceSequence.related.target

{:.dl-horizontal .dl-definition}
Definition
: The target reference sequence for the specified related.relatedType.
