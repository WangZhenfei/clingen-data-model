Scope and Usage
---------------

All alleles are described relative to a ReferenceSequence by way of the SimpleAllele.ReferenceCoordinate 
[see SimpleAllele](../simple_allele/index.html). Both the SimpleAllele position (or coordinate) and sequence 
at that postion are relative to the ReferenceSequence.

The current version of the model was based on four specific types of conceptual reference sequences; 
ChromosomeReferenceSequence, GeneReferenceSequence, TranscriptReferenceSequence and AminoAcidReferenceSequence.
It is

Context
-------

The ReferenceSequence resource is described by the following aspects:

* identifier (mandatory) - all users of reference sequences SHALL be sure of the identity of the reference sequence.
* referenceSequenceType (mandatory) - describes the kind of reference sequence.
* chromosome - the code representing one of the chromosomes, should be provided when the sequence represents a 'chromosome' 
(see [value set](/allele/implementation/value_set_list/reference_sequence_chromosome.html)).
* cdsStart - the start position of the coding sequence, when the reference sequence is a coding transcript. 
NOTE: Unlike reference coordinates, this is a 1-based index representing the position of the nucleotide.
* cdsEnd - the end position of the coding sequence, when the reference sequence is a coding transcript. 
NOTE: Unlike reference coordinates, this is a 1-based index representing the position of the nucleotide.
* gene - identifies the gene related to a 'gene' or 'transcript' reference sequence.
* referenceGenome - describes the genome build in which the chromosomal reference sequence is referenced.
* related reference sequences - other reference sequences that provide context about the primary reference 
sequence. See notes below for more info.

Notes
-----

* This version of the ReferenceSequence resource only considers the related reference sequence associations 
between amino acid and transcript reference sequences. This has constrained the scope of codes in the 
[value set](/allele/implementation/value_set_list/reference_sequence_relationship_type.html) for the 
ReferenceSequence.Related.relatedType attribute. 


Definitions & Bindings
------------------

{:.h4-definition}
#### ReferenceSequence

{:.dl-horizontal .dl-definition}
Definition
: Consensus sequence of a portion of the genome against which alleles are aligned and described.

Control
: 1..1

Requirements
: For every SimpleAllele.ReferenceCoordinate there must be a corresponding reference sequence.

{:.h4-definition}
#### ReferenceSequence.identifier

{:.dl-horizontal .dl-definition}
Definition
: The versioned accession that can be used to uniquely identify the sequence in a public database, 
as well as the information about which entity assigned the accession, and the time period over 
which the identifier is considered valid.

Control
: 1..1

Type
: Identifier

Requirements
: For ReferenceSequence, an identifier is valid unless the accession is withdrawn. If a new version 
of a sequence is created, it will be given a different versioned accession, and therefore a different 
identifier. In this case, the previous identifier is still valid: it can still be used to retrieve 
the given sequence, even if that sequence is no longer the most recent sequence associated with a 
given entity.
