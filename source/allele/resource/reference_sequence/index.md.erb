Scope and Usage
---------------

All alleles are described relative to a ReferenceSequence by way of the SimpleAllele.ReferenceCoordinate [see SimpleAllele](../simple_allele/index.html). Both the SimpleAllele position (or coordinates) and sequence at that postion are relative to the ReferenceSequence.


Context
-------

The ReferenceSequence resource is described by the following aspects:

* identifier (mandatory) - all users of reference sequences SHALL be sure of the identity of the reference sequence.
* referenceSequenceType (mandatory) - describes the kind of reference sequence.
* chromosome - the code representing one of the chromosomes, should be provided when the sequence represents a 'chromosome' (see [value set](/allele/implementation/value_set_list/reference_sequence_chromosome.html)).
* cdsStart - the start position of the coding sequence, when the reference sequence is a coding transcript. NOTE: Unlike reference coordinates, this is a 1-based index representing the position of the nucleotide.
* cdsEnd - the end position of the coding sequence, when the reference sequence is a coding transcript. NOTE: Unlike reference coordinates, this is a 1-based index representing the position of the nucleotide.
* gene - identifies the gene related to a 'gene' or 'transcript' reference sequence.
* referenceGenome - describes the genome build in which the chromosomal reference sequence is referenced.
* related reference sequences - other reference sequences that provide context about the primary reference sequence. See notes below for more info.

This resource is referenced by [SimpleAllele](/allele/resource/simple_allele) & [Gene](/allele/resource/gene)


Notes
-----

* This version of the ReferenceSequence resource only considers the related reference sequence associations between amino acid and transcript reference sequences. This has constrained the scope of codes in the [value set](/allele/implementation/value_set_list/reference_sequence_relationship_type.html) for the ReferenceSequence.Related.relatedType attribute.

Details & Bindings
------------------

#### ReferenceSequence

{:.dl-horizontal}
Definition
: Consensus sequence of a portion of the genome against which alleles are aligned and described.

Control
: 1..1

Requirements
: For every SimpleAllele.ReferenceCoordinate there must be a corresponding reference sequence.

#### ReferenceSequence.identifier

{:.dl-horizontal}
Definition
: The versioned accession that can be used to uniquely identify the sequence in a public database, as well as the information about which entity assigned the accession, and the time period over which the identifier is considered valid.

Control
: 1..1

Type
: Identifier

Requirements
: For ReferenceSequence, an identifier is valid unless the accession is withdrawn. If a new version of a sequence is created, it will be given a different versioned accession, and therefore a different identifier. In this case, the previous identifier is still valid: it can still be used to retrieve the given sequence, even if that sequence is no longer the most recent sequence associated with a given entity.

#### ReferenceSequence.referenceSequenceType
