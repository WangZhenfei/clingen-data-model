  - property: identifier

    type: Identifier
    definition: >
      The assigned identifier that uniquely describes this CanonicalAllele

  - property: active
    control: 1..1
    type: boolean
    definition: Is the CanonicalAllele active, or is it invalid or superceded by a different CanonicalAllele.
    requirements: >
      The `replacement` property MUST contain one or more items if this is *true*, otherwise `replacement` MUST be empty.

    binding: CanonicalAlleleComplexity
    definition: Is the CanonicalAllele represented by one SimpleAllele, or is it a composition of multiple CanonicalAlleles?
    requirements: |
      If this allele is simple, then it can contain one or more SimpleAlleles in the relatedSimpleAllele property.

    control: 0..*
    type: CanonicalAllele
    definition: The set of SimpleCanonicalAlleles that compose this ComplexCanonicalAllele
    requirements: |
      This is closely related to the complexity and relatedSimpleAllele fields:

      * if `complexity` is simple, then this list MUST be empty
      * if `complexity` is complex, then this list MUST contain 2 or more CanonicalAlleles (each
        with `complexity` simple) AND relatedSimpleAllele MUST be empty.

      Note that this means that the cardinality of this property is actually 0,2..* (i.e. anything but one)

Scope and Usage
---------------

A CanonicalAllele is a reference to a sequence change, independent of any particular representation relative to a ReferenceSequence. Since alleles are represented as a change (or no change) relative to a ReferenceSequence, a CanonicalAllele is composed of potentially multiple such representations (SimpleAlleles) that correspond to the same CanonicalAllele. One SimpleAllele is selected as the preferred representation of a CanonicalAllele
