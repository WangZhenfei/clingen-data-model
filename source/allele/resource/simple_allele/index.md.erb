title: SimpleAllele
layout: resource
alias: simple allele, allele, variant, sequence variant, snv, amino acid variant, dna change, aa change
description: A representation of an allele relative to a reference sequence. A CanonicalAllele is a composition of these, with one SimpleAllele selected as a prefered representation.

Scope and Usage
---------------

A CanonicalAllele does not exist outside the context of a SimpleAllele; a CanonicalAllele is represented by one or more simple alleles. 

Context
-------

The SimpleAllele resource is described by the following attributes.

* identifier[]: The set of identifiers that describe the SimpleAllele
* canonicalAllele: The CanonicalAllele associated with the SimpleAllele
* sequenceType: The type of sequence referred to by the SimpleAllele (nucleotide/amino acid, etc)
* allele: HGVS expression representing the SimpleAllele
* primaryNucleotideChangeType: type of change if SimpleAllele represents a nucleotide change (insertion, deletion, etc.)
* ancillaryNucleotideChangeType[]: additional change types for nucleotide simple alleles for finer classification when desired.
* primaryAminoAcidChangeType: type of change if SimpleAllele represents an amino acid change (frameshift, etc)
* ancillaryAminoAcidChangeType[]: additional change types for amino acid simple alleles for finer classifcation when desired.
* ReferenceCoordinate: The coordinates of the allele relative to a ReferenceSequence
* AlleleName: Identifiers giving the allele a unique name, possible HGVS expressions, etc.
