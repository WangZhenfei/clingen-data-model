## Publishing the documentation

The documentation is hosted as a GitHub page (https://pages.github.com), based on the following repository:
https://github.com/clingen-data-model/clingen-data-model.github.io

Publishing is currently a manual process, but is not overly complicated:

0) Clone the remote repository to the build directory
1) Build the site (bundle exec middleman build)
2) CD to the build directory (cd build)
3) Stage new pages and push the repository to the remote site.
